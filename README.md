# DataJoint Workflow - Optogenetics

The DataJoint Workflow for Optogenetics combines multiple DataJoint Elements for
optogenetics research.  DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and automate data
collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments.  Each Element is a modular
pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be
combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

Installation and usage instructions can be found at the
[Element documentation](datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-optogenetics).
